Hello world!

I'm Qingkai(pronounced as Ching-kai) Dong. This is my personal academic website. Currently I'm a phd student in [Statistics in UConn](https://statistics.uconn.edu/). My research interests include massive data subsampling, frequentist model averaging and survival data analysis. I'm interested in programming, too.
