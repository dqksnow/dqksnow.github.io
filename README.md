Hello world!!

I'm Qingkai(pronounced as Tsing-kai) Dong. This is my personal academic
website. Currently I'm a PhD student in
[Statistics](https://statistics.uconn.edu/) in UConn. My research interests
include massive data subsampling, frequentist model averaging and survival data
analysis. I'm interested in programming, too.

## Software

### R package [subsampling](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/subsampling/index.html)
Balancing computational and statistical efficiency, subsampling techniques offer
a practical solution for handling large-scale data analysis. Subsampling methods
enhance statistical modeling for massive datasets by efficiently drawing
representative subsamples from full dataset based on tailored sampling
probabilities. These probabilities are optimized for specific goals, such as
minimizing the variance of coefficient estimates or reducing prediction error.

## Experience

### Research Assistant, University of Connecticut and Servier
- **Duration:** Mar 2024 - present
- **Description:** A project on the application of machine learning methods in
adaptive clinical trial design. It includes the development of models for
predicting survival times of censored individuals and their application to
improve the accuracy of conditional power estimates for interim analyses.

### Research Assistant, University of Connecticut
- **Duration:** Sep 2023 - present
- **Description:** Summarized literature on subsampling methods in statistical
models. Developed an R package which provides optimal subsampling methods for
various statistical models such as generalized linear models, softmax
regression, rare event logistic regression and quantile regression model.

### Research Assistant, University of Connecticut
- **Duration:** Jul 2024 - Aug 2024
- **Description:** A project about the impact of social determinants of health
(SDOH) and frailty index on accelerated aging in breast cancer patients. It
includes pre-processing the data and performing statistical analyses on the All
of Us platform.
