Hello world!!

I'm Qingkai(pronounced as Tsing-kai) Dong. This is my personal academic website. Currently I'm a PhD student in [Statistics](https://statistics.uconn.edu/) in UConn. My research interests include massive data subsampling, frequentist model averaging and survival data analysis. I'm interested in programming, too.
